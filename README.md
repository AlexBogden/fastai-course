# Fastai Course – Bird Classification Model 🐦

This repository contains my work from the [Practical Deep Learning for Coders](https://course.fast.ai/) course by fast.ai. This notebook demonstrates how to train an image classification model using transfer learning with your own custom data.

## 📝 Notebook

### [`01-bird-classifier.ipynb`](01-bird-classifier.ipynb)

In this notebook, I:

- Used the `fastai` library to build a custom image classifier
- Applied transfer learning with a pretrained ResNet model
- Collected and labeled images using Bing image search
- Trained the model to classify whether an image **is a bird or not**
- Evaluated model performance and exported it for inference

## 🚀 Tech Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebooks
- fastai / PyTorch
- Transfer Learning
- Bing Image Search (via DuckDuckGo)

## 📌 Goal

To apply deep learning techniques to a real-world image classification problem using the `fastai` library, and gain hands-on experience in building and training custom models.

Stay tuned as I complete more lessons and experiments from the course!
